The main purpose thiupdate PlanMyTrip app and to take it to the possible next level.
First, we add weather descriptin to the weather data  we retrived by using lattitude and longtuide coardinates.
Secon, we prompt input statment to use a beta tester to fillter weather preferences.Third, 
using weather preference information we identify potential tourist destinationss and nearby hotels. Finally, 
we create a travel route between selected tour cities and we also create a marker layer map using the Google Maps Directions API.
## Result
### Retrieve Weather Data

Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data you gathered in this module, use your API skills to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.
